# We always need to collect static files to be served by server. 
# in the case of development server, Django collects static for us under the fhood.
# Steps:
1- set debug to false 
2- various look on settings, apps installed and every thing
3- collecting static and setting its root folder. 
4- choose a method of the 3 for serving the static files. 
5- make sure you have run makemigrations, and migrate commands.
6- make sure you have a super user, and database is initialized with its schema.
7- make sure you run your project inside a virtual env.
8- from inside the virtual env, run ==> python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
9- elasticBeanStalk ==> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-1#/welcome
10 - what django config does is that it tells elastic bean stalk that any request should be forwarded to this python object file.
11- folders/files to be uploaded:
    - .ebextensiont
    - blog
    - db.sqlite3
    - manage.py
    - my_site
    - requirements.txt 
    - staticefiles
    - templates
